TurtleBot is a low-cost, personal robot kit with open source software. The TurtleBot kit consists of a mobile base, 3D Sensor, laptop computer, and the TurtleBot mounting hardware kit. I have installed ros kinetic version. I have installed the turtlebot3 package, turtlebot3 simulation package, and launched a simulation file
